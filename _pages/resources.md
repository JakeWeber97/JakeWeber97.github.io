## Resources
I would like to share some of the resources and tools I believe to be pretty awesome. I have them broken down by audience below.

### Students
- [Desmos](https://www.desmos.com) is a powerful graphing and computational tool.
- [Paul's Notes](https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu) presents excellent math coursework guides, examples, and instruction for undergraduate underclassmen.
- [Overleaf: LaTex Editor](https://www.overleaf.com/) is a collaborative text editor capable of producing robust math text. 

### Instructors
- [Journal of Inquiry-Based Learning in Mathematics](http://www.jiblm.org) is a collection of instructor guides (and student acompaniament) for leading inquiry-based instruction on a plethora of mathematical topics.
- [Illustrative Math](https://im.kendallhunt.com) & [Illustrative Math Tasks](https://tasks.illustrativemathematics.org) is a collection of learning outcome based tasks for middle and high school level math topics. This site is changing often as some tasks have become part of the premium version offered.
