# Jake's Stuff:

## About Me

My name is Jake Weber, and I am a fourth year mathematics doctoral candidate at Louisiana State University (LSU) studying (structural) graph theory and working under Dr. Guoli Ding (LINK HIS SITE). I recieved a B.A. & M.A. in Mathematics at the University of Northenrn Iowa, and I anticipate graduating with a M.S. in Computer Science and a Ph.D. in Mathematics from LSU in May 2025.

I enjoy questions that are combinatorial in nature. This has led me to working on Ramsey-like qustions in my M.A. Thesis and continuing in graph theory. Currently, I am working on a stronger characterization for the class of line graphs (of multigraphs). Outside of mathematics, I have enjoyed computer science coursework in algorithms, artificial intelligence, and machine learning.


When I'm not studying or working at LSU, you can usually find me:
- Biking or running on the Mississippi levy trail or around the university lakes
- Bowling at All Star Bowl in Baton Rouge or playing tennis at the University Recreation Center (UREC)
- Playing saxophone and trumpet to keep my skills intact
- Crocheting or playing board/card games such as cribbage or SET
- Sipping tea from my favorith spot, The Tea Cellar, located in Cedar Falls, IA (Link)

Group Involvement: SigEp, Iowa Irish Fest, Bowling etc. Sigma Phi Epsilon: Alumni Board Member at SigEp LA Beta (LSU), Keeping Tigers Safe (LSU), GEAUX Orientation Program (LSU Math), Sigma Phi Epsilon: VP of Finance/Member, Kappa Mu Epsilon: President/Member, UNI Bowling Club President/Member,
Iowa Irish Fest Committee: Member, Student Fees Committee --- LSU/BR Safety Forum Organizer and Chair, LSU Discover Day Judge, SigEp Sexual Assault Awareness Week (Annually in April), St. Vincent de Paul (thrift store renovation project & food drive support)
