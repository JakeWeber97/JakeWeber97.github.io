## Mathematics
- **[General Exam Website Development](https://certifiedmathemagician.github.io/generalexam/) - Summer/Fall 2024**
    - Focusing on their respective specialties and preparation methods for the mathematics general exam, Megan Fairchild and I developed and implemented a comprehensive feedback system for graduate students and professors. Together, we spearheaded the creation and launch of a dedicated general exam website, serving as a resource for future students to enhance their preparation and performance.

- **Exploration in Ramsey Theory, [Masters Thesis](https://scholarworks.uni.edu/etd/1022/), University of Northern Iowa – Spring 2020**
    - Conducted research independently of known results, guided by Dr. Adrienne Stanley. Established introductory results on two-color classical Ramsey and Cycle-Complete Ramsey numbers. Determined Cycle-Complete Ramsey number for the special case of $f(C_k ,K_3 )$ for $k ≥ 3.$

- **Exploration of Counterexamples of Balanced Sets, [Honors Thesis](https://scholarworks.uni.edu/hpt/342/), University of Northern Iowa – Spring 2018**
    - Collaborated with Dr. Adrienne Stanley in identifying and classifying sets of $ Z_p × Z_p $ spaces that do not have balanced subsets.

- **The Genetic Algorithm: Relevance Beyond Biology, Preparing for Industrial Careers (PIC) Math, University of Northern Iowa – Spring 2016**
    - Gathered previous research, contributed to implementation and editing of code, and analyzed program results. Proposed a solution [a genetic algorithm] to the problem addressed [plane routing efficiency]. Built presentations for the collaborating business and an academic audience. (Support provided by the NSF and NSA through the MAA)

## Computer Science
- **[Group Decision Making Processes by Means of a Graph Theoretic Approach: Football AP Top 25 ] - Fall 2025**
    - In progress
