## Mathematics
- **[Classes Between Line Graphs and Claw-Free Graphs](https://github.com/JakeWeber97/academic-projects) - Spring 2026**
    - **Abstract:** A line graph $L(G)$ of $G = (V, E)$ is the graph with vertex set E in which $x, y \in E$ are adjacent as vertices if and only if they are adjacent as edges in G. In 1970, Beineke (and Robertson independently) discovered a forbidden induced subgraph characterization for the class of line graphs of simple graphs. Bermond and Meyer in 1973 generalized this characterization to the class of line graphs of multigraphs, denoted $\mathcal{L}$. One such obstruction of these classes is $K_{1,3},$ the claw. In 2008, Chudnovsky and Seymour fully characterized the set of claw-free graphs. In this talk, we present explicit and constructive characterizations of several classes between $\mathcal{L}$ and claw-free graphs. These constructions aim to provide an alternative approach, with fewer graph classes and operations, to that of Chudnovsky and Seymour. This talk is based on joint work with Guoli Ding.

- **[General Exam Website Development](https://certifiedmathemagician.github.io/generalexam/) - Summer/Fall 2024**
    - Focusing on their respective specialties and preparation methods for the mathematics general exam, Megan Fairchild and I developed and implemented a comprehensive feedback system for graduate students and professors. Together, we spearheaded the creation and launch of a dedicated general exam website, serving as a resource for future students to enhance their preparation and performance.

- **Exploration in Ramsey Theory, [Masters Thesis](https://scholarworks.uni.edu/etd/1022/), University of Northern Iowa – Spring 2020**
    - Conducted research independently of known results, guided by Dr. Adrienne Stanley. Established introductory results on two-color classical Ramsey and Cycle-Complete Ramsey numbers. Determined Cycle-Complete Ramsey number for the special case of $f(C_k ,K_3 )$ for $k ≥ 3.$

- **Exploration of Counterexamples of Balanced Sets, [Honors Thesis](https://scholarworks.uni.edu/hpt/342/), University of Northern Iowa – Spring 2018**
    - Collaborated with Dr. Adrienne Stanley in identifying and classifying sets of $ Z_p × Z_p $ spaces that do not have balanced subsets.

- **The Genetic Algorithm: Relevance Beyond Biology, [Preparing for Industrial Careers (PIC) Math](https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=60178), University of Northern Iowa – Spring 2016**
    - Gathered previous research, contributed to implementation and editing of code, and analyzed program results. Proposed a solution [a genetic algorithm] to the problem addressed [plane routing efficiency]. Built presentations for the collaborating business and an academic audience. (Support provided by the NSF and NSA through the MAA)

## Computer Science
- **[Group Decision Making Processes by Means of a Graph Theoretic Approach: Football AP Top 25](https://github.com/JakeWeber97/academic-projects) - Spring 2026**
    - **In progress:** 
        - One could pose the simple problem: Based on the results of game play over the regular season, which teams are worthy to continue play in the postseason? Every fan has an opinion on this topic; however, the standard polls ranking the top NCAA teams throughout the season could be considered as representative of the national consensus. This clearly is contested and gives rise to why one could study the dynamics of such polls. In addition, the separate polls for the top teams may have discrepancies, and this leads to the question of, "Who actually got the ranking right?"
        - We look at the NCAA Associated Press (AP) Top 25 poll through a graph theoretic lens and determine group dynamics that speak to how the group makes decisions, ultimately deciding which teams make the playoffs and which do not.
