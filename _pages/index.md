## Intro
My name is Jake Weber, and I am a sixth year mathematics doctoral candidate at [Louisiana State University](https://www.lsu.edu) (LSU) studying (structural) graph theory and working under [Dr. Guoli Ding](https://www.math.lsu.edu/~ding/). I received a B.A. & M.A. in Mathematics at the [University of Northern Iowa](https://uni.edu), and I anticipate graduating from LSU with a Ph.D. in Mathematics and a M.S. in Computer Science: Systems Science  in May of 2026.

I enjoy questions that are combinatorial in nature. This led me to work on Ramsey-like questions during my master's thesis at UNI (advised by Dr. Adrienne Stanley) and has encouraged me to continue in graph theory. Currently, I am working on a set of characterizations for classes of graphs between line graphs (of multigraphs) and claw-free graphs. Outside of mathematics, I have enjoyed computer science coursework in algorithms, artificial intelligence, databases, and machine learning.

When I'm not studying or working at LSU, you can usually find me:
- Biking or running on the Mississippi levy trail or around the university lakes
- Bowling at All Star Bowl in Baton Rouge or playing tennis at the University Recreation Center (UREC)
- Playing saxophone and trumpet to keep my skills intact
- Crocheting or playing board/card games such as cribbage or SET
- Sipping tea from my favorite spot, [The Tea Cellar](https://teacellartea.com), located in Cedar Falls, IA
