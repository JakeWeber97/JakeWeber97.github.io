## Tutoring

I am currently offering tutoring services as my schedule allows. I tutor a wide variety of subjects predominantly in mathematics but have also worked with students with courses that are computational in nature*. These subjects include but are not limited to:
- Algebra & Trigonometry
- Calculus (1, 2, & 3), Linear Algebra, Differential Equations
- Probability & Statistics
- Discrete Mathematics
- Introduction to Proofs
- Python
- *Operations Management, Economics, Business Statistics, etc.

I work with students of all levels (high school, college, and graduates) and would be happy to chat about your personal needs.

 **Please email me if you would like to set up an initial consultation meeting!**

## Math Lab
[Check out my experience working in two different university mathematics labs!](/experience/#math-lab)

At UNI, I assisted students of different backgrounds with any math/computational course they were enrolled in. At LSU, I work with students enrolled in MATH 1020/1021/1022: College Algebra & Trigonometry.
